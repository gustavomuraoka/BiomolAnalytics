# BiomolAnalytics
BiomolAnalytics is a quick solution to analyze genetic sequences, giving plenty of useful information.
Basic DNA -> RNA -> Protein translation;

TODO:
  - Find potential proteins inside a given DNA sequence, analysing each frame to find all possible result;
  - Provide GC-Content-Related analysis, mainly the difference between gene GC-Content/Regular sequence GC-Content and graphs about incidence of both nucleotides in the sequence;
  - Comparing sequences to provide phylogenetic info when given few genetic sequences;
  - Maybe implement some graphic interface instead of console + .txt mechanic
